### About

Welcome to Roll Bar, an interactive place to test out and create different sushi roll combos.

#### How to Navigate

There is one built in data point, but essentially, create a roll, then add ingredients to that roll and other related attributes.

##### Installation Instructions

To use this program, go to your terminal and enter the following.

bundle install
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed

That should load the backend and data. Following,

npm start (runs the rails server)

Lastly, navigate to the frontend folder:

open index.html (opens the index or view-type page which you can interact with)

In order to complete the last two steps, make sure you have two tabs open in your terminal.
